These are the kinds of questions which can\nbe answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac\nNewton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of\nphysics, but it will never go out of style. \nIt remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and\nis constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called\nNew Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July\n14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed\nusing classical mechanics, and nothing\nmore.</p>",

    "description": "This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that’s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today’s and tomorrow’s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. <br><br> Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout. <br><br> In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. <br><br> The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.",

You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one, download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers.

    "description": "This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this \"globalization.\" That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today's globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?",

The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly\nface. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms\ntrying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.\n<br>\n<br>Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why\nwe rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.\n<br>\n<br>Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week, you’ll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations.\nArmed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it – and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.<br><br>Join your future classmates and course alumni on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/\">Facebook</a>!<br>",

    "description": "The comic book pamphlet developed as an independent literary form in the 1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species\nof pulp fiction on the margins of children’s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing\nnumber of university classrooms and bookstore shelves.\n<br>\n<br>“Comic Books and Graphic Novels” presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today. It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop in concert with, and\nparticipate in literary culture, they should be considered literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine our concept of literature itself. Finally, it explores this transformative literary world by arguing that comics have\nmuch to teach us about ourselves.\n<br>\n<br>Get started by enrolling in an upcoming session, then print out the official course playset and get started!\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/xyO6Usw\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xyO6Usw.jpg\"></a>",

    "description": "“Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea.” --George Orwell<br><br> Neuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that “(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.” This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.<br><br> <strong><br></strong>",

In this MOOC we will teach the concepts and computational methods in the exciting interdisciplinary\n    field of bioinformatics and their applications in biology, and help you acquire knowledge and skills in bioinformatics that can be valuable in your future study and research.</p>\n<p>The past three decades had seen extraordinary development in both life sciences and computer sciences. The unprecedented opportunities and challenges fueled the creation and growth of bioinformatics as a new interdisciplinary field. In one dimension,\n    bioinformatics is a powerful new technology for the efficient management, search, and analysis of petrabytes of biomedical data. In another dimension, bioinformatics is also a new top-down, genome-scale, system-oriented scientific methodology that\n    complements traditional experimental approaches in life science research.\n</p>\n<p>The driving force of bioinformatics is the exponentially growing amount of big data generated by high-throughput biological technologies such as next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry. These big data is a gold mine for new discoveries, new patterns,\n    and new hypotheses. At the same time, the data is heterogeneous with low signal-to-noise ratio. Handling such big data requires advanced, efficient and accurate computational methods and computer tools.</p>\n<p>In this MOOC we will teach the important concepts and methods in bioinformatics. We will cover the underlying algorithms starting from simple sequence alignment and sequence search, and move on to genome alignment, next-generation sequencing data analysis,\n    and molecular pathway identification. We will tell you where to find the data and software, and use case studies to show you how to apply bioinformatics methods to study biological questions. We will also use software and databases that we had developed\n    in our own labs  to illustrate how to develop new bioinformatics technologies. In addition, we try to provide a historical perspective of why and how the methods were developed. For instance we have interviewed Dr. Michael Waterman, who co-developed\n    the important Smith-Waterman algorithm and is a pioneer and leader of the field of bioinformatics, and asked him to tell us how he and Temple developed the algorithm.

This course explores linkages between climate change\n    and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community\n    livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such\n    as biodiversity and water quality).&nbsp; We acknowledge the urgent need\n    to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits)\n    simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability\n    and climate change to provide an avenue for achieving these objectives.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>Each of our cells contains nearly identical copies of our genome, which provides instructions that allow us to develop and function. The field of Genomics focuses on the structure and function of genomes and plays a major and increasing role in both medicine and research. This course serves as an introduction to the main laboratory and theoretical aspects of genomics and is divided into themes: genomes, genetics, functional genomics, systems biology, single cell approaches, proteomics, and applications. We start with the basics, DNA sequencing and the genome project, then move to high throughput sequencing methods and applications. Next we introduce principles of genetics and then apply them in clinical genetics and other large-scale sequencing projects. In the functional genomics unit, we start with RNA expression dynamics, analysis of alternative splicing, epigenomics and ChIP-seq, and metagenomics. Model organisms and forward and reverse genetics screens are then discussed, along with quantitative trait locus (QTL) and eQTL analysis. After that, we introduce integrative and single cell genomics approaches and systems biology. Finally, we conclude by introducing in applying proteomic approaches.</p><div><br></div>",

    "description": "<p><i><b></b></i>It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically\n    modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional\n    values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning,\n    the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread\n    in modernity.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>The Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating\n    analyses of this complex phenomenon. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks\n    insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one,\n    the Greek philosopher Socrates.</p>\n<p><span>In his famous work <i>The Concept\nof Irony</i> Kierkegaard examines different forms of subjectivism and\nrelativism as they are conceived as criticisms of traditional culture. He\ncharacterizes these different tendencies under the heading of “irony.” He\nrealizes that once critical reflection has destroyed traditional values, there\nis no way to go back. But yet the way forward is uncertain. As the modern\nmovements such as Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism reveal,\nthe issues that Kierkegaard faced are still among the central problems of\nphilosophy today.</span>\n</p>",

The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You'll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they're being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You'll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We'll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances — and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we'll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it's applied intelligently. Along the way, you'll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You'll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count — or why you should reasonably be skeptical.",

    "description": "We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.\nWhy do models make us better thinkers?\nModels help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.\nHere's how the course will work.\nFor each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free.

Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent\nneeds and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself\nin many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy\ngodmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical\nviewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,\nfrom <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Avatar</i>, is the most important in our modern\nworld because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound\nways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,\nshape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will\nexplore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art\nand as insights into ourselves and our world.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<h2>Work Expectations</h2>\nFor further information about the coursework, please see the <a href=\"http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.html\"> Work Expectations</a> page.",

    "description": "<b></b>\n\n<p>Man has always used external materials to help prevent, cure, or alleviate\n    the symptoms of disease. In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute\n    of the History of Pharmacy has written&nbsp;that, “...the very concept\n    of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered\n    one of humanity’s greatest advances.” Since its independent&nbsp;origins\n    in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated\n    to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients\n    get the best outcomes from medication therapies.</p>\n<p>So what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?</p>\n<p>This course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction\n    to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving\n    scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues\n    relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into\n    the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.</p>\n<p>As we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists\n    throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what\n    they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications.\n    Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career\n    path that you want to pursue! &nbsp;Whether student or healthcare consumer,\n    you’re sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.</p>",

    "description": "This is Part Two of a two-part course; you can find Part One <a href=\"https://class.coursera.org/money-001/class\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&nbsp; The description below pertains to the course as a whole, both parts.<br><br>The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.<br><br>Three features of the new system are central.<br><br>Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse. &nbsp;<br><br>Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective. &nbsp;Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.&nbsp;<br><br>Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.",

    "description": "Qui était Jean Calvin ? Pourquoi ses idées ont-elles exercé une telle\ninfluence au 16e siècle et dans les siècles suivants ? Ce cours cherchera\nà répondre à ces deux questions.\n<br>Il mettra en évidence l’humanisme de Calvin, sa compréhension de la pensée\nbiblique, son acuité théologique, son sens aigu des problèmes sociaux et\npolitiques. Nous aurons aussi l’occasion d’évoquer l’apport de Calvin à\nla culture (notamment à la langue française, qui lui doit considérablement)\net à la conception de l’humain devant Dieu et dans la société. Nous verrons\négalement comment Calvin fit de Genève la capitale d’une idée et d’un idéal\nde vie chrétienne, en pensant le rapport au travail et à l’argent ou en\ncréant des institutions comme la Compagnie des pasteurs, le Consistoire\net l’Académie.\n<br>Ce cours mettra également en évidence la place que Calvin occupe dans\nl’histoire de la tolérance, ou plutôt de l’intolérance, religieuse :\nl’affaire Servet (du nom de ce savant espagnol condamné à mort à Genève\npour hérésie) fera ainsi l’objet d’une analyse spécifique. Nous tenterons\négalement de montrer les apports de la théologie de Calvin (notamment la\ncompréhension renouvelée d’un Dieu en qui l’humain peut faire confiance)\net ses limites (par exemple la doctrine dite de la prédestination).\n<br>Ce cours d’introduction fera également une place à l’histoire du calvinisme\nen Europe (France, Allemagne, Provinces-Unies, Angleterre) et dans le monde\n(Amérique, Afrique du Sud, Asie).\n<br><i>Le cours est donné en français avec sous-titres en anglais.<br>---<br></i>Who\nwas John Calvin? Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th century\nand well beyond his time? This course seeks to answer these two questions.\n<br>We will present his humanistic leanings, his interpretation of the Bible,\nhis theological vision, his acute sense of social and political questions.\nWe will consider his contribution to culture, how he contributed to shaping\nFrench language, his understanding of the human before God and in society.\nThe course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Geneva\ninto an idea and an ideal of Christian life, by thinking the meaning of\nwork and money, but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions\n(the « Company of Pastors », the « Consistory » and\nthe « Academy »).\n<br>The course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration,\nor rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of Michel\nServet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed\nin Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvin’s theology, we will show both\nhis lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whom\none may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instance\nhis doctrine of predestination).\n<br>Towards the end of this introductory course, we will turn our attention\nto the history of Calvinism in Europe (France, Germany, the United Provinces,\nEngland) and in various parts of the world (Americas, South Africa and\nAsia).\n<br><i>Course in French with English subtitles.</i><br>",

Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more.

    "description": "With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.&nbsp; Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),&nbsp; a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>",

    "description": "<p><i>Plagues,\nWitches, and War</i><span>\nwill provide an engaging introduction to the genre and craft of historical\nfiction<i>.</i> You will learn\nabout some of the classics in the genre while encountering five established and\nemerging authors of historical fiction (including a Pulitzer Prize winner and\nseveral <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers) who\nwill be visiting our class as guest writers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>We’ll begin the course by reading together from\na number of classic historical novels from England and the US: Scott’s <i>Waverley</i> (often described as the first historical novel), Charles\nDickens’s <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> (set\nin Paris and London during the French Revolution), William Wells Brown’s <i>Clotel</i> (the first novel in the African\nAmerican literary tradition, set in part around the time of Thomas Jefferson), and\nseveral others. Given the length and complexity of these novels, lectures will\ncover <i>selected excerpts only</i> while providing\nan overview of the development of historical fiction during the nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries. We'll then move into the twentieth century, with lectures on modernism, metafiction, the mass market, and the New Historical Novel of Latin America. You should think of these initial parts of the course as\nproviding a kind of toolkit for your future reading in the genre. What\nmotivates certain writers to turn to particular historical moments, and what do\nthey hope to find there? What creative challenges do historical settings and\npersonages present to authors seeking to reimagine the past in fictional\nnarrative?</span></p>\n\n<p>Guided by similar\nquestions, the second part of the course will consist of a series of seminars on\nthe craft of historical fiction. These seminars will feature five novelists who\nwill be our guests for recorded workshop and discussion sessions as well as on-line forums\nand chats with Coursera students. We are lucky to have an extraordinary line-up\nof guest artists whose novels bring to life an array of past cultures, from\nancient Rome to Renaissance England to nineteenth-century Malaysia. We will\nread selections from these authors’ novels along with some of the original\nhistorical sources that inspired their fiction. During these sessions our\nguests will discuss the process of research, the crafting of character,\nsetting, and dialogue, and the challenges of historical fiction as a genre,\namong other topics. (See below for the list of guest\nwriters.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span>Along with these\nintroductions to the genre and craft of historical fiction, you will have a\nchance to research and, if you wish, begin crafting your own historical\nfiction. All students will be assigned to identify either a local archive in their\nimmediate geographical area or a virtual archive on line. This archival\ncomponent of the course, which you’ll be encouraged to share in the forums, on the\ncourse Facebook page, and over our Twitter stream, will expose you to a wealth\nof historical materials inspiring your peers around the world. For those\nwishing to attempt writing historical fiction themselves, an <i>optional</i>, <i>ungraded assignment</i> will allow you to post a brief piece of creative\nwork to be read and commented upon by your fellow students.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Historical fiction immerses\nus in the past in new and unexpected ways, even while teaching us much about\nthe present. I hope you’ll join me as we explore this immensely rewarding genre\nand learn from some of its most talented contemporary practitioners. &nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p><b><i>Here are our visiting writers, with links to their books and home pages:</i></b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.janealison.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Alison</a>, Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Virginia, is the author of three novels (including <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Sea-Jane-Alison/dp/B000J3EGJY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370529368&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=marriage+of+the+sea\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The Marriage of the Sea</i></a>,&nbsp;a New York Times Notable Book for 2003) as well as a memoir,&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sisters-Antipodes-Memoir-Jane-Alison/dp/B0058M9NFI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370529335&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sisters+antipodes\" target=\"_blank\">The Sisters Antipodes</a></i>.

In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria,&nbsp;Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.<br><br>After we’ve covered the basics,&nbsp;we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too. We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology.&nbsp;And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.&nbsp;<br><br>And there's one more thing: during the course, we'll be running a massive online epidemic with you, the participants - virtually, of course. You can signup for this epidemic game online, at <a href=\"http://www.moocdemic.com\" title=\"Link: http://www.moocdemic.com\">www.moocdemic.com</a>. <br><br>We're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!<br></div>",

Our goal in this course is to gain more understanding of what U.S. foreign policy is, who makes it, why is it the way it\n    is, and how it affects the rest of the world. Through lectures, readings, and other course elements we build on the information available from the media and other such sources while delving deeper into the issues, their history, their broader context\n    and major debates. We seek to do so as a community of learning committed not only to the curricular objectives for our course, but seeking to demonstrate to the world how to conduct informed and respectful discourse on subjects which have plenty of\n    room for disagreement.</p>The first week of the course provides an overview and analytic framework, and focuses in on the process and politics by which U.S. foreign policy is made. Each of the next five weeks is geared to U.S. foreign policy in different\nregions: Asia with a particular focus on U.S.-China relations; the Middle East and such issues as Iran, Arab-Israeli peace, Syria, and the Arab uprisings; relations with Western Europe and Russia; relations in the Western Hemisphere with Latin America\nand Canada; and key issues in U.S.-Africa relations. While we cannot cover all issues, we do try for a balance of breadth and depth.",

    "description": "Complex analysis is the study of functions that live in the complex plane, i.e. functions that have complex arguments and complex outputs. In order to study the behavior of such functions we’ll need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We’ll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once we’ve answered these questions we’ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of \nthese that’s quite alright, but do look at \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set</a> for example to see some \nbeautiful pictures).<br><br>When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation – a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don’t worry! We’ll help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.&nbsp; After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We’ll explore these properties! <br><br>Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we’ll have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects we’ll integrate over? Curves! We’ll study these as well, and we’ll tie everything together via Cauchy’s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Throughout this course we'll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won't be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures. <br>",

Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity.\nWeekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis\nof the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior\nsessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also\nbe a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span><b>Student Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course:</b>\n    <br>\n<span>\"An amazing course - a joy to take.

In classrooms that are\nEmotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and\nexcited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know\nthat, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>What do you need to <b>know</b> to be a really effective early childhood\n    teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge – knowledge about children’s\n    development, about the content they’re teaching, about effective teaching\n    practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms,\n    and about themselves. In this course we’ll focus a bit on knowledge about\n    children’s development and we’ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge\n    about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and\n    development.</p>\n<p>Another part of effective teaching is <b>seeing</b>. All the knowledge\n    in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good\n    teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like – in lots of different\n    types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers\n    tell us they don’t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers\n    teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get\n    them. We’ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom\n    videos and we’ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.</p>\n<p>Ultimately we can’t learn to be an effective teacher without practice\n    – we need to spend some time <b>doing</b> – enacting the teaching practices\n    that we’ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really\n    learn about them – you need to spend some time practicing the types of\n    interactions we’ll be talking about.</p>\n<p>There’s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective&nbsp;\n    teachers spend time <b>reflecting</b> on their practice. We think of this\n    a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying\n    glass – we’ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have\n    learned throughout this course.</p>\n<p>Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget\n    Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom\n    Assessment Scoring System – or CLASS(™). CLASS is an observational measure\n    used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective\n    teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching\n    practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe\n    and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to\n    increase the effectiveness of teachers' interactions with young children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span>\n <span><span>\n  <span>\n  <p>*********************************************************************</p>\n  </span>\n </span>\n</span></span><p>\n\n</p><p>The development of the course was funded, in part, by the\nInstitute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant\nR305A100154-11 to the University of Virginia.&nbsp;\nThe opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent\nviews of the U.S. Department of Education.&nbsp;</p><br>",

    "description": "Frustration. Hard Knocks. Sleepless nights. Tears.\n<br>\n<br>Those are just a few of the ways that rookie teachers describe their first\nyear in the profession. And those sentiments have been validated by countless\nresearch studies that show that students, on average, learn significantly\nless when they’re taught by rookies. Unfortunately, many educators believe\nthis is a necessary “rite of passage” – a sort of hazing that one must\nexperience on their path to effective teaching.\n<br>\n<br>We don’t believe that.\n<br>\n<br>Over the past 6 years, the Match Teacher Residency has developed and refined\nan approach to specifically address the challenges that are unique to the\nrookie teacher experience. In this four-week course, we’ll explore the\nthree ideas that we've found to contribute radically to success as a rookie\nteacher.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Develop Classroom\nManagement Automaticity</b><br>\n<br>Certain skills that delay a novice are automatic for an expert. Dribbling\na basketball. Driving a car. Addressing classroom misbehavior is similarly\ndifficult for a novice and effortless for an expert. At one moment the\nnovice teacher might let a particular misbehavior slide entirely; at another\nthey might respond too harshly; and at yet another they might respond with\nhalting uncertainty. In this part of our course, we’ll cover concrete techniques\nand exercises that can help a rookie teacher develop the classroom management\nautomaticity of an expert.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Practice\nGood Ratio </b><br>\n<br>Teachers love the spotlight. Often, a natural taste for being the center\nof attention might have drawn somebody to teaching in the first place.\nBut we’ve concluded that there’s an inverse relationship between a teacher’s\ntalking and his/her students’ learning: the more you talk, the less they\nlearn. Doug Lemov from Uncommon Schools first coined the term “Ratio:”\nthe amount of teacher work in a lesson compared to the amount of student\nwork. Rookie teachers tend to have very bad Ratio because they often spend\nmore energy thinking about their lessons in terms of what they want to\nsay rather than what they want their students to do. In this part of our\ncourse, we’ll address when and how to use specific techniques such as “Turn\nand Talks” and “Stop and Jots” and “Student-to-Student Interactions” to\nget students to do more of the intellectual heavy-lifting in lessons.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Call Parents</b><br>\n<br>Many preparation programs counsel new teachers to build positive relationships\nwith parents, but few show them exactly how to approach that work. Lacking\nthose details, it’s no surprise that rookie teachers quickly become overwhelmed\nby all of the aspects of their job that seem more pressing and urgent.\n“Sure it would be nice to have better relationships with parents, but it\ncertainly doesn’t feel like a priority, when I’m drowning in papers to\ngrade, lessons to plan and a messy class to organize!” We understand that\nsentiment, but we believe a teacher should view his/her investment of time\nin building relationships with parents as a key strategy for motivating\nstudents to give more effort in class. In this part of the course, we will\nvery precisely show teachers how much time to spend phoning parents, what\nto say, and how to say it.\n<br>\n<br><b>Course Learning Outcomes:<br><br></b>\n\n<p>o   To describe the concept of classroom management automaticity\n    as it relates to student learning outcomes for rookie teachers.</p>\n<p>o   To describe, analyze and practice techniques that enhance\n    management automaticity.</p>\n<p>o   To describe the concept of Ratio as it relates to student\n    learning outcomes for rookie teachers.</p>\n<p>o   To describe, analyze and practice techniques that enhance\n    instructional Ratio.</p>\n<p>o   To describe the impact of calling parents on student learning\n    outcomes. </p>\n<br>\n<br>",

    "description": "This course, part 2 of a 2-course sequence, examines the&nbsp;history of rock, primarily as it unfolded in the United States,&nbsp;from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana,&nbsp;and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;<br><br>Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the&nbsp;hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana leads alt-rock's&nbsp;return to simplicity in the early 1990s.&nbsp;",

Stories about\n    companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is\n    pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the\n    Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street\n    Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type\n    of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis\n    is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding\n    the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in\n    the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible\n    impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the\n    workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that\n    being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.\n    <br>\n    <br>This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis.\n    The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and\n    write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and\n    widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components\n    analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical\n    details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques\n    to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the\n    results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also\n    have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with\n    their data analyses.</div>",

Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state&nbsp;by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors.</p><p>In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of event-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.</p>The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects.",

    "description": "<p>I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Students have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.</p>\nThe course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.<br><strong><br>Why Study Automata Theory?</strong><br><br>This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than \"push this button.\"<br><br>The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.<br><br>During the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.",

    "description": "Design\nthinking is a popular new idea in the business world - organizations as diverse\nas entrepreneurial start-ups, big established corporations, and government and\nsocial service organizations are experimenting with design thinking as an\nalternative approach to traditional problem-solving. Accelerated by the\nspectacular rise of Apple and IDEO, design thinking is seen as offering a new\napproach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth\nand innovation faced by so many organizations today. But design thinking can\nremain mysterious for people interested in introducing this approach into their\ndecision-making processes. Demystifying\nit is the focus of this course.\n\n<p><span>Though <i>designing</i> as a\ncraft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, <i>design thinking</i>, as a problem solving\napproach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that\ncontains four </span>questions and ten tools:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><img src=\"https://coursera-topic-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/12e27d2216ba70fd7089556c788733/design_business.jpg\"><br><span>The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an\nassessment of current reality <i>(What is?),</i>\nthe envisioning of a new future (<i>What\nif?),</i> the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (<i>What wows?</i>), and the testing of some of\nthose in the marketplace (<i>What works?</i>).\n</span>The process of design thinking begins\nwith data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a\ngreat deal of data on the users they want to create value for.  They mostly do this through ethnographic\nmethods like experience mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus\ngroups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new\nideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from\nthe real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven. That is, they treat\ntheir new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions\nunderlying their hypotheses and test them – usually looking for the kind of\nbehavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value\npropositions. </div>\n\n<p>Accompanying the four\nquestions is a set of new tools to help business people achieve the same kind of\ndisciplined approach to innovation and growth that they bring to the rest of\ntheir business. In this course, we will look at the stories of a wide variety\nof organizations - major corporations like <b>IBM</b>, entrepreneurial start-ups\nlike <b>MeYouHealth</b>, and even social service\norganizations like <b>The Good Kitchen</b> - all using the design\nthinking tools and approach to achieve better outcomes.</p>",

Then we’ll see that much\nof the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there's\nnot much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome\nI’d see that they are 98.5% identical.

Scholars estimate\nthat teachers have over 1000 unique exchanges with students every day, most of\nwhich are unplanned and require quick decision making. And then there are the\nmyriad daily decision points related to curriculum planning, assessing student\nwork, and interactions with parents and colleagues. Amidst this frenzy, it’s\neasy for “bad” habits to set in, and hard to break them once they do.<br></p>\n\n<p>The question then becomes: </p>\n\n<p><b><i>How in such a fast-paced environment can coaches\nand instructional leaders help teachers execute changes in their practice that\nactually stick?&nbsp; </i></b></p>\n\n<p>Effective teacher-coaches are not just knowledgeable about\ninstruction; they’re also highly strategic in their approach to changing\nteachers’ behaviors. That starts with preparing teachers to receive critical\nfeedback, and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds to\nensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity. </p>\n\n<p><span>Oftentimes, teacher coaching suffers from a lack of\ndirection, a lack of support, or both. The coach might tell the teacher to “Do\nX,” but then fail to articulate clear, measurable steps for\nimplementation.&nbsp; Most commonly, coaches\ncan be overly suggestive, telling the teacher “You <i>might</i> do X, Y, and Z,\nand <i>maybe</i> even A, B, and C, too.” With an already very full plate, this\napproach leaves the teacher uncertain of what to focus on first, undercutting\nthe likelihood of meaningful change. </span></p>\n\n<p>Even teacher coaching that’s described as “good” can sometimes\nfall short of resulting in meaningful change. The coach might see and say the\nright things, and the teacher might be very appreciative of the feedback. But\nunless the coaching drives true changes in behavior, the “good” in this case\ncould actually end up being the enemy of effective. </p>\n\n<p>Match Education trains and employs dozens of coaches who\nprovide intensive support for teachers in Boston and New Orleans. Course\nparticipants will be introduced to Match’s Five key principles of effective\ncoaching, which strike the right balance between providing clear direction for\nteachers, while giving them the support they need to achieve their goals: </p>\n\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<b>Permission-based\nCoaching</b></p>\n\n<p>Teachers first need to permit themselves to receive\ncoaching in order for meaningful change to occur. A skillful coach needs to\nknow how to ask for and create buy-in for this level of permission. In this\nsession of the course, we focus on concrete strategies that help teachers\nreceive and process critical feedback, while maintaining a “growth mindset”\nabout their practice. </p>\n\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<b>Shared\nVocabulary and Vision</b></p>\n\n<p>A teacher coaching relationship must begin with a shared\nvocabulary for talking about instruction, and a common vision for what\nexcellent teaching looks like. In this session of the course, we introduce a\nsimple observation rubric and several video exercises that a coach could use\nwith a teacher to communicate the parameters of what s/he will be looking for\nwhen s/he conducts classroom observations.</p>\n\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<b>Selecting\nand Setting Measurable Goals </b></p>\n\n<p>Novice teachers, in particular, often describe the feedback\nthey receive from expert coaches as akin to “drinking from a fire hose” –\nthere’s so much to work on that it becomes difficult to identify and prioritize\nnext steps for their practice. In this session of the course, we focus on how\nto analyze classroom instruction and select a single, measurable goal that\naddresses a particularly high leverage aspect of a teacher’s practice. </p>\n\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<b>Delivering\nDirective Feedback</b></p>\n\n<p>We believe that teachers need to leave a coaching feedback\nsession with absolute clarity about the steps they should take to achieve their\ngoals. However, the clarity of those steps could easily be obscured by a coach\nwho struggles to deliver candid feedback or to help the teacher articulate\nconcrete, actionable solutions. In this session, we introduce and practice a\nprotocol for debriefing a classroom observation that ensures that teachers have\nthe direction they need to successfully implement a coach’s feedback. </p>\n\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<b>Create\nOpportunities for Practice </b></p>\n\n<p>Great coaches don’t just leave it to chance that a teacher\nis ready to implement feedback after merely discussing what to do. They first\ntry to create opportunities for the teacher to rehearse or apply the action\nsteps in the presence of the coach before the teacher attempts to do it in the\nclassroom. In this session, we explore different exercises for practicing\naction steps within a coaching feedback session.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>Course Learning Outcomes</b><br></p><p></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTo\ndescribe and analyze strategies that help a teacher develop a growth mindset\nabout accepting and acting on critical feedback.</p>\n\n<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTo\ndescribe and analyze tools (e.g. observation rubrics) that help teachers and\ncoaches develop a shared vocabulary and vision about excellent classroom\npractice. </p>\n\n<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTo\nderive clear and measurable improvement goals for teachers based on\nobservations of their practice. </p>\n\n<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTo\ndescribe and analyze protocols for delivering directive, actionable feedback to\nteachers. </p>\n\n<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTo\ndescribe and analyze exercises that generate meaningful opportunities to\npractice implementing feedback.&nbsp;</p><p></p>",

    "description": "Tinkering is an age-old human practice that has recently been introduced\ninto the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement,\nand innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective\nmeans to engage students in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena.\nTinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along\nwith a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s self expression.\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering\nactivities. Working with learning scientists, we have identified a set\nof design principles and indicators of learning that can help you to integrate\ntinkering activities into your elementary and middle school science programs.\nThis course will focus on key design elements of high quality science-rich\ntinkering activities, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. Selected classroom tinkering activities will involve electricity and magnetism as well as force and motion.&nbsp; Using a library of video exemplars, we will review the ways in which tinkering\nsupports students' science learning through providing opportunities for\nthem to deepen engagement, intentionality, innovation, collaboration, and\nunderstanding. This course will excite you, inspire you, and get you and\nyour students tinkering in no time.<br>",

Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry. <br><br> In this course we will explore what we know about life’s ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection. The course will provide a foundation in astrobiology and introduce students to concepts in a diversity of scientific fields.",

It was always part of a global\neconomy, tied into networks of capital, labor, and commodity markets that\nspanned continents. The wealth of the slave South was absolutely central to the\npolitical and economic growth of the U.S. and its emergence as a continental\nempire in the nineteenth century, but ultimately that system had to be\ndestroyed for the country to claim its place as a world power.<br>\n<br>\nWhy that was – why the U.S. experienced a brutal Civil War in the 1860s – is a\nmatter of considerable contention among scholars and a central theme of the\ncourse. The history of the South is a crucial part of the story of the rise of\nthe U.S. as a global power and it is particularly compelling because of its\nhistory as a slaveholding society, the wealthiest in the western world in 1860.\nThis course is about the ethical and political questions that history\nnecessarily poses about the relationship between slavery, capitalism, and\ndemocracy in U.S. and world history.  It is about the rise and fall\nof the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of\nthe American Civil War.<b></b></p>",

If you enroll, you'll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You'll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus.&nbsp;<br><br>Genomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connecting&nbsp;genetics&nbsp;to your ancestry among ancient humans.<br><br>The course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You'll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today.&nbsp;At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations.</div>",

But, how should the friends decide where\nto go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a\nchoice that is “fair” taking into account everyone’s opinions or must we choose one person\nfrom the group to act as a “dictator”?

If the cake is homogeneous (e.g., a chocolate cake with\nvanilla icing evenly distributed), then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piece\nthat is the same size.

The past two\ndecades of research on learning, and more recent framings of academic goals\n(especially the Common Core State Standards) bring this insight to the\nforefront. This short course, designed for as few as four weeks and as many\nas eight, asks how teachers can and do capitalize on what students bring\nto the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings – to\nadvance the learning of all students in the class.\n<p>Our overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge\n    and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students\n    to learn challenging subject matter – a practice we call “leveraging student\n    thinking”.</p>\n<p>Course content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various\n    disciplines, but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable\n    to ALL subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design\n    of curricular tasks, the analysis of patterns of talk, and the use of representational\n    tools to:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>elicit student thinking,</li>\n    <li>attend to significant features of that thinking,</li>\n    <li>interpret students’ ideas within a developmental framework, and</li>\n    <li>bridge from students’ current understandings to more sophisticated understandings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases.\n    Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging\n    student thinking, and also will illustrate the epistemic, academic, developmental\n    and managerial “pressure points” that challenge teachers’ ability to capitalize\n    on student thinking in constructive ways.</p><p>Throughout the course, participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms,&nbsp;be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class, a scout troop, a homeschool opportunity, or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate, but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.)&nbsp; The goal is to&nbsp;work on the work of teaching&nbsp;<i>while</i>&nbsp;teaching.</p><p>In addition, critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course. &nbsp;At&nbsp;key&nbsp;points, participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback.&nbsp;Therefore, we strongly encourage teachers to&nbsp;plan on working through&nbsp;this course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation, analysis and discussion.

    "description": "<p>Scandinavia is well known internationally\nfor its welfare society, and part of this welfare society is a very developed\ncultural policy based on both the free market and public support. Scandinavia\nhas a strong film and television culture with institutions and traditions\ncreated to secure creative diversity for both national, Scandinavian and global\naudiences. In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global cultural\nbrand, connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social values\nconnected to a liberal and progressive welfare society. Dating back to the\nsilent cinema era and through the birth of a modern film and television culture\nafter 1945 Scandinavia has contributed significantly to our global cultural\nheritage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>This course in <i>Scandinavian Film and Television</i> deals with the social,\ninstitutional and cultural background of film and television in Scandinavia and\nin a broader European and global context. The course will offer a deeper\nunderstanding of the creative forces behind film and television, of how\nScandinavian society and culture has influenced the production. The course will\ndeal with the co-production in Scandinavia and the role of Scandinavian film\nand television internationally. Theoretically the course will deal with\nnational and global cinema, with film and media sociology, with genre and\nauteur theory and with film and media policy.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>The course will also deal with some of the\nmost important film directors and film and television genres and the way they\nhave reflected and influenced our understanding of Scandinavia and the image of\nScandinavian culture and society abroad. From Carl Th. Dreyer’s complex\nhistorical and religious dramas, Ingmar Bergman’s symbolic and psychological\nfilms to the modern cinema of Lars von Trier, Aki Kaurismäki, Lukas Moodyson\nand Bent Hamer - all important Scandinavian names in a broader European art\ncinema tradition.&nbsp; The course will deal\nwith typical examples of other and more popular genres in Scandinavian cinema\nand modern, Scandinavian television drama and with aspects of the Scandinavian\ndocumentary tradition. Examples include Jan Troell’s epic serial <i>The Immigrants/The New Land </i>(1971-72), global,\nprize winning drama series like <i>The\nKilling</i> (2007-12) and <i>Borgen</i> (2010-)\nand international film blockbusters such as the Stieg Larson trilogy.</span></p>",

What is the range of conditions for these planets to host life? In this course, students will engage with a wide range of concepts in astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology and physics with a focus on developing the background they will use need to think further about this profound question. We will explore the origin and evolution of  life on Earth, particularly in extreme environments, the properties of planets and moons in our Solar System,  the properties of stars and the newly discovered extrasolar planets.<br><br>Course assignments include two short papers describing proposed space missions to study nearby planets and to search for extrasolar planets and a final paper. In the final paper, students will have an opportunity to invent their own planetary system and describe it in terms of either the astronomy of how it was discovered, the properties of their planet and its host star, or the biology of life in the system. Papers will be circulated and evaluated by fellow students as part of the learning experience in the course; this will provide opportunities to develop students' abilities to think like a scientist by applying principles of scientific thinking, to learn new ideas from other students, and to creatively make new connections across different sciences and parts of the course.<br>",

Whitehead</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere\nWhitehead points out how Plato pulled it off: by writing all the ‘heresies’ in\nadvance. That is, whenever anyone says Plato was wrong—and how, and why—it\nturns out Plato himself said it first. (As P.T. Barnum said—but maybe Plato\nproved it first?—there’s no such thing as bad publicity. And the cover-up is\nusually worse than the crime. That's as true in philosophy as in US politics)</p>\n\n<p>In\nthis course, students study Plato’s ancient art of blowing up your beliefs as\nyou go, to make sure they’re built to last. We spend six weeks reading three\nPlatonic dialogues (a bit like plays, in which we see two sides of an argument\ncome to life.) Then, for two more weeks, we study a pair of footnotes. That is,\nwe will consider some contemporary manifestations of issues Plato discusses.\nOur focus will be: moral theory and moral psychology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It\nturns out: the more you blow up your beliefs, the more they stay the same (as I\nmentioned already).</p>\n\n<p>Why\n‘Reason and Persuasion’? The title is generic, and indicates that the course\nwill be - if this is what you are looking for - a general, introduction to\nphilosophy, as it tends to be taught at the university level. But the title\nalso points to a specific problem: reason without persuasion is useless;\npersuasion without reason is dangerous. Plato worried about it. So will we.</p>\n\n<p>The\ncourse will be of interest to a wide variety of students. There are a variety\nof reasons why you might want to know at least a little about what Plato\nthought and wrote. I will do my best to teach in a way that accommodates as\nwide a range of likely interests in the subject as i can manage.</p>\n\n<br><br><br>",

My research clearly showed that\n    many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them\n    by growth, as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building\n    the right management team that can play well together. The research shows\n    that every growth business faces common challenges.

Each case tells a compelling story.\n    You will learn from Barbara Lynch, Ryan Dienst, Steve Ritter, Randy Bufford,\n    John Gabbert, and Mike Cote. In addition, each week, we will discuss a\n    different content theme. In Week 3, you will engage in a Workshop where\n    you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will\n    have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to\n    learn from each other as the Course progresses.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>You will learn how entrepreneurs must grow, too; the “secret” of high\n    performance; people-centric leadership; how to create high employee engagement;\n    how to create an internal Growth System; and how to build a senior management\n    team.</div>",

    "description": "<p>This\ncourse will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on\nmammalian cells, their constituents and their functions.&nbsp; Biology is moving from molecular to modular.\nAs our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists\nof molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need\nto understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that\nact as discrete functional systems.&nbsp;\nThese systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal\ntransduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn\nthese processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,\nproliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular\nand cellular systems?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the\nmechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise?&nbsp; What types of experiments inform systems-level\nthinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these\nsystems?</p>\n\n<p>The course will develop multiple lines of\nreasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads\nare: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that\nproduce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations.&nbsp; Examples will be discussed to demonstrate\n“how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to\npredict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.<br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of\n    science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs\n    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.\n    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve\n    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce\n    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.&nbsp;\n    Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,\n    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.</p>\n<p>Although parallel computing will be covered, this is <i>not</i> a class\n    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days\n    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,\n    the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,\n    desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and\n    students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still\n    be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.</p>\n<p>Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools\n    such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control\n    systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and\n    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.</p>\n<p>High performance <i>programming</i> is also an important aspect of high\n    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course\n    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as\n    a computational scientist.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Particular attention is paid to the ways market-led macro-economic reforms\n    associated with globalization (such as free trade agreements and privatization\n    initiatives) have come together with much more micro innovations in how\n    personal behavior is organized by market forces (rethinking education as\n    a personal investment practice, for example, or outsourcing dating to for-profit\n    companies).  Mediating between these macro and micro scales of capitalist\n    transformation are a wide array of other market-based mechanisms examined\n    in the course.  From bond risk ratings to the market metrics shaping\n    FICO scores, personalized medicine and online mapping, these market-mechanisms\n    require close examination. Tracing their influence with an awareness of\n    their material geographic variation and unevenness, the course offers an\n    alternative to economistic assumptions about choice-maximizing behavior\n    on a ‘level playing field’. It explores instead the complex uneven development\n    dynamics of globalization in ways that allow you to see how your own personal\n    perspectives on these dynamics are at once outcomes and enablers of economic\n    and social change.  And, by doing so, the course aims in turn at enabling\n    you to be a more engaged participant in the ongoing debates over the direction\n    these dynamics <i>should</i> take.  Key words that are debated, defined\n    and/or explained in the course include: globalization, interdependency,\n    discourse, capitalism, neoliberalism, value, financialization, harmonization,\n    competition, governance, governmentality, power, citizenship, choice, accountability,\n    enclaving, geopolitics, biopolitics, biocapital and global health.</p>",

We should not forget the community\n    structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors.\n    This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote\n    the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’\n    and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure\n    and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation\n    of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into\n    the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize\n    that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected,\n    we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community.\n    Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating\n    community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change\n    and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition\n    of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation\n    and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation\n    in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability\n    of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory\n    approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed\n    Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other\n    essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as\n    insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution,\n    deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n</div>",

Each module\nexcept the first is built around an important health problem.&nbsp;The\nfirst module reviews the scientific method and the role of experimentation\nand observation to generate data, or evidence, relevant to selecting among\ncompeting hypotheses about the natural world. Bayes theorem is used to\nquantify the concept of evidence.

The concepts\nof point and interval estimation are introduced. Students will master the\nuse of confidence intervals to draw inferences about population means and\ndifferences of means. They will use stratification and weighted averages\nto compare subgroups that are otherwise similar in an attempt to estimate\nthe effects of smoking and smoking-caused diseases on medical expenditures.\n<br><span><br>In the final module, we will study what factors influence child-survival in Nepal using data from the Nepal Nutritional Intervention Study Sarlahi or NNIPPS. Students will estimate and obtain confidence intervals for infant survival rates, relative rates and odds ratios within strata defined by gestational period, singleton vs twin births, and parental characteristics. </span>",

    "description": "What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends’ faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.<br><br> The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.",

    "description": "<p>This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>\n<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>\nAn optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.<br>I hope you enjoy the course!\n<p><strong>Why Study Compilers?</strong></p>\nEverything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.\n<div></div>",

    "description": "<p>Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the application of computational models to text or speech data. Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.</p>\n\n<p>In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.</p>",

A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes. &nbsp;This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes. &nbsp;A third reason is that this is simply more interesting. &nbsp;The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning. &nbsp;It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.",

However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to do&nbsp;justice to this device.&nbsp;If you want to really know how the MOSFET&nbsp;operates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically.

    "description": "One of the most interesting\nand important developments in social science since 1970 has been the\n\"discovery\" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great\ncommon law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the\nthousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property\nand contract provide the institutional\nscaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability\nsystems of tort and crime appear to&nbsp;mimic market exchange in areas of human activity\nwhere free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This\ncourse seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close\ninvestigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of\nsome simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior\nbackground in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic\nconcepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,\nspecific topics in the law, including property, tort&nbsp;and crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure,&nbsp;are considered. Each group of lectures will\nelaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questions&nbsp;to which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and\nmodes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but\nthe questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subject&nbsp;that affects everyone&nbsp;are challenging and\nprovocative. <p></p>",

Macroeconomics\nis a word derived from the Greek prefix “makros”, meaning large. It is the study\nof economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the\neconomic management role played by governments and international organisations.\n</p>\n\n<p>The founder of\nmodern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote\n“The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right\nand when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,\nthe world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be\nquite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some\ndefunct economist.” This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the\ninfluence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,\nunemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.</p>\n\n<p>We will cover\nimportant macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment\nand inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid\nthe foundation for governments’ active management of the macroeconomy in the\npost war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal\npolicy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; Economists’ approaches to the analysis of\nlong run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be\ncritical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate\nand disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not\nshy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic\ntheorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach\ntheir task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed\nanalysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy\ndebates.</p><p><i>Image source: Nilss Olekalns University of Melbourne 2012</i><br></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?</strong></p>\n<p>Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.",

    "description": "In this course we will seek to “understand Einstein,” especially focusing\non the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old\npatent clerk, introduced in his so-called “miracle year” of 1905. Our goal\nwill be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations\nof relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein\nthe person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his\ntheory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein\ncome up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the\nmeaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity?\nWhy did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean\nto say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more\nslowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending\non their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things\ntravel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the\ncenter of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence\nthat definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why\ndidn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\n<br>\n<br>Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative\napproach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more\nquantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more\nqualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young\nEinstein and/or the special theory of relativity.\n<br>",

If you are fascinated by shows like CSI, and have enough basic chemistry, this course would be great for you. However, the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree.<br><div>Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.</div>",

    "description": "<p></p>\n<p>In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long contribution\n    to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights\n    in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When the first\n    steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at preventing\n    the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War Two,\n    the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never\n    have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the\n    supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities\n    consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members – and\n    deepen – from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities\n    to the current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence.\n    At the same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of\n    the biggest crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle\n    difficult questions about the continued existence of the Euro and the future\n    direction of the European integration project.</p>\n<p>This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU,\n    a vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the\n    legal systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided into three\n    parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the\n    development of the EU, its institutional structure and functioning, and\n    the specific nature and sources of EU law. In the second part, we will\n    examine how EU law impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies\n    that are established or provide services in the EU. In the final\n    part, we will tackle Europe’s common currency crisis, investigating causes,\n    effects and possible routes out of this existential crisis of the Union.</p>\n<p>If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply interested in the\n    EU, its&nbsp;development and legal system, this course will provide you\n    with the foundations.&nbsp;The course is of interest to people both inside\n    and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit from\n    the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may\n    learn from the EU’s specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions\n    being applied in the European context.</p>",

The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem. </div><div><br></div><div>A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (<i>e.g.</i>, neighbor joining). </div><div><br></div><div>Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are  investigating.

In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree <i>will</i> be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer. </div><div><br></div><div>Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).</div><div><br></div><div>Topics covered:<br><br></div><ul><li>Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.</li><li>Mechanisms of molecular evolution.</li><li>Models of substitution.</li><li>Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.</li><li>Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).</li><li>Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian statistics).</li></ul><div><br></div>",

Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures\nhave invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home\nfor human beings through the development of culture (and technology).\nThroughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated\ncounter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster – destructive\nof both art and of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nWestern idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of\nmodernism.

As we learn about the foundations\nbehind such software, we will use this knowledge to more effectively create\nmusic with it, and we will also write a series of short software programs\nthat extend the software’s ability to manipulate, transform, and analyze\nsound.<br><br><b>Grading Policy:</b><br><p>There will be a quiz at the end of each module (except module 0) for a total of 6 quizzes. Quizzes consist of multiple-choice and short-response questions and cover lecture material from the module.</p><p>There are two hands-on projects in the course, due at the end of module 3 and at the end of module 5. These projects will be graded through a peer assessment system.</p><p>The grade breakdown is as follows:</p><ul><li>60% - quizzes</li><li>40% - projects</li></ul><p>In order to receive a statement of accomplishment, you must get 70% or higher for the course. In order to receive a statement of accomplishment with distinction, you must get 90% or higher for the course.</p>",

    "description": "The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.<br><br>Three features of the new system are central.<br><br>Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  <br><br>Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. <br><br>Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.<br><br><br>",

School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The primary audience is first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind.

This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector,&nbsp;Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;<br><br>Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previously&nbsp;had remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelic&nbsp;by the end of the decade.",

    "description": "<p>Phones, diesel engines, animated newspapers, medical devices, games, political\n    campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so\n    on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least\n    partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs\n    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming\n    a more and more valuable skill.</p>\n<p>To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the\n    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general\n    skill of how to design a program.</p>\n<p>This course presents a <b>design method</b> that will enable you to approach\n    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for\n    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop\n    in the future.</p>\n<p>Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem\n    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how\n    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You\n    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally\n    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.\n    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and\n    to test your program as you develop it.</p>\n<p>In the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple\n    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards.&nbsp;</p><p>A second phase of the course, to be offered later, &nbsp;will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular\n    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This\n    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem\n    domain interests you.<br></p>",

Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for \"the end of the lecture as we know it\"; instead, most of the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style -- offering models or samples of readers' interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.",

We will consider why individuals are attracted to this ideology and how they radicalize to violence. We will also explore the way in which the United States addressed terrorism prior to 9/11 and the policy challenges it (and its allies around the globe) faced in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. <br><br>The second part of this course -- to be offered sometime in 2014 -- will examine the policy \"aftermath\" of 9/11. <b>Part II </b>will examine how the United States changed its policies in response to 9/11 in three areas: the use of military force, law enforcement and intelligence activities, and homeland security.

In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance\nwas increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed\nimmediate questions of decorative language&nbsp;\n(antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of\nconceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic\nstructural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first,\nthe new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system,\nand only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural\nconceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms\nand models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first\naffirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.</span>\n\n</p>\n<p>Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance\n    architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance\n    theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces,\n    technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista Alberti’s\n    to Francesco di Giorgio’s and Bramante’s proposals.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>",

Dallo spazio e\ntempo assoluti e indipendenti si è passati ad una descrizione di un mondo in cui\ndistanze ed intervalli di tempo dipendono da chi le osserva, in cui l’ordine di\naccadimento di due eventi non è univoco, in cui la velocità del tempo segnato\nda un orologio dipende da quali corpi si trovino vicino. Nel microscopico si è\ninvece abbandonata la descrizione della fisica classica, magari caotica, ma\nsempre deterministica, per arrivare ad una descrizione probabilistica, in cui\ngli stati e le proprietà del mondo microscopico non sono determinati, a priori,\nintrinsecamente, ma acquisiscono realtà solo se vengano misurati o se entrino\nin contatto con altri “oggetti”. L’abbandono della realtà locale, del fatto\ncioè che le azioni esercitate in un luogo, per particolari sistemi, possono\navere effetti istantanei su oggetti a distanze virtualmente infinite,\nstravolgono la descrizione di un mondo che fino al secolo scorso sembrava\nsensato e ragionevole. Nel corso verranno descritte le principali\ncaratteristiche di queste due teorie, di come abbiano cambiato il concetto del\nnostro universo e delle possibilità di conoscerlo, e di come abbiano influito\nnella vita quotidiana.<p></p>",

    "description": "Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organization&nbsp;–&nbsp;business,\nnon-profit, or government.\n<br>\n<br>Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It\nstarts a “conversation” with users and stakeholders inside and outside\nan organization.&nbsp; Conversations are the natural way people think about\ncomplex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop “stories,”\nwhich lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy\npractitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departments\nand sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.\n<br>\n<br>In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that\nif they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their\njob descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier\n– creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is\nvalued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their\nenterprise stand out.\n<br>\n<br>Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy\npractitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile\nmedia to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,\nactionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic\ncontent they produce enhances the audience’s lives and&nbsp;deepens their\nunderstanding and engagement with the organization.\n<br>\n<br>Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it\nis done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,\ntrustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.\nOften it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional\njournalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not\nadvertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it\nnever pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.\n<br>",

    "description": "<p><b>On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement </b></p>\n\n<p></p><p>Teaching\nis isolating. &nbsp;Most of the work happens behind a closed door.\n&nbsp;Teachers want feedback about their teaching, but encounter three\nproblems:</p>\n\n<p>1.\nThey don't get much. &nbsp;The principal or department head doesn't visit very\noften. &nbsp;And there’s no built-in structure at their school for peer\nobservation. </p>\n\n<p>2.\nThe feedback isn't helpful or actionable. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes\nit's just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- and\nwhile everyone likes a pat on the back, evaluations that say \"you were\nwonderful\" don't make better teachers. &nbsp;Or sometimes the feedback is\ncritical in ways that don’t present clear next steps. &nbsp;Sometimes it's\nvague or just plain wrong. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3.\nSome teachers can be defensive. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Yes,\nwe know – only SOME people are defensive, but not YOU. &nbsp;You are different.\n&nbsp;You handle feedback with grace, confidence, and a \"let's fix\nthis\" orientation. {Except&nbsp;sometimes maybe not.}) </p>\n\n<p>***</p>\n\n<p>This\ncourse is based on a simple idea: that teachers take control of their own\nimprovement by aggressively seeking out and acting upon feedback about their\nteaching. </p>\n\n<p><span>The\nidea may be simple, but the work is not. So we should say straight up: <b>this\nis NOT a typical MOOC</b>. Participants in this MOOC won’t improve their\nteaching skills by just watching lectures. Participants also won’t really take\nanything away from this MOOC if they do it “a la carte:” we believe they need\nto do every part of every assignment in order to leverage the kinds of changes\nin practice that we think are possible in a course like this. </span></p>\n\n<p>We\nall wish that our public school system was such that every teacher would have\neasy access to great coaching – or even any coaching at all. But unfortunately that’s\nnot the world we live in. Indeed, high school athletes can EXPECT to be\ncoached, but schoolteachers somehow need to track it down themselves. Teachers\ndeserve better. But they have a choice: bemoan\nthe lack of legit coaching that they get and will likely continue to get, or\nbecome the rare teacher who builds her own improvement loop. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n1: The Big Picture on Teacher Feedback</b></p>\n\n<p>We\nwill review the realities of teacher feedback in typical schools, looking at\nwhere that feedback usually comes to teachers and how it’s processed.&nbsp; In\nmost schools, the teacher plays a passive role in this—waiting until an\nevaluation comes to them.&nbsp; We believe the best teachers create the\nopposite type of process: they HUNT down feedback, drag it back to their lairs,\nand use it. &nbsp;They realize that if they wait for good feedback to come to\nthem, they might wait a long, long time. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n2:&nbsp; Case Study: Peer Feedback</b></p>\n\n<p>We\nprofile teachers&nbsp;who've&nbsp;asked their peers to give them critical\nfeedback. How did they ask their colleagues for help? What rubric or\nobservation protocol did they use? How did they choose what to focus on after\nthey got the feedback? What kind of action/improvement plan did the teacher\nwrite? What happened when the teachers tried to implement their action steps?\nWhat did their peers say when they came back to their classroom a few weeks\nlater? </p>\n\n<p>Participants\nin this course will do the exact same assignment: they will seek out feedback\nfrom a peer to generate their own action plan and a reflection on its\nimplementation. Participants will also be assigned to give and receive feedback\non these action plans from other students in our MOOC who are working on\nsimilar focus areas in similar contexts (e.g. other math teachers who are\ntrying to improve the rigor of their questioning). </p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n3:&nbsp;Case Study: Student Feedback</b> &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First\nwe review the emerging new evidence, from the Gates Foundation MET Project,\nabout student surveys and their power for accurately assessing teachers’\nstrengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;Then, similar to the Peer Feedback class, we\nshow a teacher going through all the steps, interspersed with commentary from\nthe course instructor.</p>\n\n<p>Again,\nour MOOC participants will do the same assignment: create a student survey\n(we’ll show you examples); administer the survey; tabulate the data; write and\nimplement a plan; and get and give feedback from/to a peer with a similar focus\narea. </p>\n\n<p><b>Class\n4: Case Study: Assessment Data</b></p>\n\n<p>First\nwe cover the evidence of how schools and teachers are using student assessment\ndata to drive instructional improvements. Then we once again examine examples\nof teachers who go through all of the steps of administering a unit assessment,\nanalyzing the data, and designing and implementing a targeted instructional\nintervention. </p>\n\n<p>MOOC\nparticipants will do the same assignment, and then get and give feedback\nfrom/to a peer who teaches a similar subject and/or grade level. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Course\nLearning Outcomes:</b></p>\n\n<p></p><ul><li>To describe both structural and psychological\nimpediments to teachers receiving effective feedback about their practice, as\nwell as strategies to overcome those impediments.&nbsp;<br></li><li>To engage in self-directed improvement via three\ntypes of data collection—action plan—reflection assignments: peer observation,\nstudent surveys, and student assessment data analysis.<br></li><li>To provide critical support and feedback to fellow\nMOOC participants who have similar teaching contexts and/or improvement focus\nareas.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

These include: <i>Manon Lescaut</i> by Abbé Prévost; two works by Herman Melville, <i>Bartleby the Scrivener </i>and <i>Benito Cereno</i>; Charlotte Brontë’s <i>Jane Eyre</i> and two stories by Franz\nKafka, “Metamorphosis” and “The Country Doctor”;\nVirginia Woolf’s <i>To the Lighthouse</i>\nand William Faulkner’s <i>Light in August</i>;&nbsp; an anthology of stories, <i>Ficciones</i>, by Jorge Luis\nBorges and <i>The Ice Palace </i>by Tarjei\nVesaas; Tony Morrison’s <i>Beloved</i> and <i>Disgrace</i> by J.M. Coetzee.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As this course will demonstrate, the most\ncritical relationships in our lives—the comings and goings that define us—are\nnot always easy to get a fix on, but literature offers us a special sighting on\nthese arrangements. Through exploratory readings of these narrative works, the\ncourse will seek to make relationship visible, bringing our traffic with the\nworld and with others into clearer focus.</p>",

This\nmay be due to either discrimination from employers or differences in unobserved\nbackground characteristics across gender.

For\nmany musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,\nrigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled\nin the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to\nperformers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to\nmillions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically\ninclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,\nyet still represents its summit.</p>\n\n<p>This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas\nfrom the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata\nand an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the\nrelationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the\ncritical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of\nextremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in\nwhich the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the\ncharacter of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis\nand historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a\nmusicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the\nperformer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s music\nitself.</p>\n\n<p></p>",

However, China is geographically too large.  Even if I conduct free workshops at remote cities, a lot of students still cannot pay for the travel expenses to attend.  Therefore, I am now making publicly available an original web course that is used by our own students. I hope all Chinese students can now enjoy this course with plenty of exercises to monitor their learning. As most of the course content concentrates on the explanation and applications of theories, the course should be useful for students who intend to use LISREL or other software.",

This is often feasible and cost-effective when manual programming is not. Machine learning (also known as data mining, pattern recognition and predictive analytics) is used widely in business, industry, science and government, and &nbsp;there is a great shortage of experts in it. If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical, but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful!</div><div><br></div><div>Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words, learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally, we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction. Throughout the class there will be an emphasis not just on individual algorithms but on ideas that cut across them and tips for making them work.</div><div><br></div><div>In the class projects you will build your own implementations of machine learning algorithms and apply them to problems like spam filtering, clickstream mining, recommender systems, and computational biology.

The course will review the driving forces of energy used in transportation, building heating and cooling, electrical loads and manufacturing. The current facts and trends of the resulting demands placed on coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, biomass, solar and wind used to meet these energy demands are then covered. The technologies and characteristics of different energy processes and infrastructure used to convert the renewable, fossil, and nuclear energy into the desired form necessary to accomplish a given task are then described. Economics is always a part of the discussion. The natural laws of thermodynamics limiting these processes are described, as well as future technologies and their potential.",

The\nonly prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation.\nOtherwise, no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explained\nin class, and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This course\nwill focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, music that exemplifies tonality, the system of major and minor\nkeys, including pieces composed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann,\nChopin, Wagner, Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others. This course will tell\ntwo competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On one\nhand, we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common, the shared\nmusical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate;\non the other hand, we will try to discover what makes each piece unique,\nhow composers bend the common language to say something new. Although the\ncourse will incorporate historical perspectives, it will not be a chronological\nsurvey. Instead, it will combine music theory with aesthetics, balancing\nprinciples of structural organization with insights into the aesthetic\nmeaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures with\nhis own performances at the keyboard, Professor Korsyn will bring the music\nto life.",

Despite striking advances in information technology, clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers, making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set. &nbsp;While television shows make this seem like a magical process, work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving.

Attending\nexplicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write\neffective arguments, understand the writing process, and craft powerful prose\nthat meets readers’ expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical response to an argument about expertise (2pp.); an explication of a visual image (2pp.); a case study of an expert (4pp.) and an Op-Ed (2 pp.). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:&nbsp; 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an\neffective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and\nengaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful across\nvirtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well.\nPerhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration\nor genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with\npractice, dedication, and working with others,<i> you</i> can be an effective academic\nwriter and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations.

    "description": "Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some\nof them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding\nof a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their\nexploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple\ntales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some\ngreat deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem\nto like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece\nand Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it\nplays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention\nto the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.\nAre myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window\non the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders\nthat all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining\nstories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate\nthese questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of\nthe universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,\nreligion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.",

    "description": "With the click of a mouse, now more than ever we are able to access sounds made by people from all around the world. And yet, most of us don't listen to the wide diversity of music available to us, probably because it sounds so strange. This class will open up the world of music to you. We begin with a brief history of recording technology, the music industry and the place of world music in that narrative; you are introduced to keywords for talking about music cross-culturally; and then proceed to half a dozen musical cultures around the world. In each of these musical cultures, we examine the ways in which music works in those distant cultures, how it sounds, what it means, who may perform it; and then we ask ourselves where this music has traveled and entered into the Western popular culture as entertainment, political discourse, or artistic purpose.",

    "description": "<p>Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining\n    what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. The current\n    understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western\n    experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This\n    course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience\n    during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the\n    new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which\n    means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance\n    of the other Parts. Part 1 addresses the issue of “Who Gets What” and covers\n    sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social\n    mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change.\n    Part 2 turns to the related issue of “Who Survives” and includes studies\n    of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development,\n    human development and social organization, and social organization and\n    social stratification. Part 3 deals with issues of identification and motivation\n    and presents studies of religion and gender, ethnicity, and nationalism\n    from late imperial times to the present-day.</p>\n<p>Our class eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic\n    approach that focuses on specific discoveries and on how these new facts\n    complicate our understanding of comparative societies, human behavior,\n    and the construction of individual and group identities. That being said,\n    while we do not emphasize the temporal narratives of late imperial, early\n    modern and contemporary China, we of course also discuss change over time\n    as China progresses from a largely domestic imperial history to the shared\n    stories of imperialism and semi colonialism, communism and collectivization,\n    and reform and globalization.</p>",

    "description": "We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions. &nbsp;We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender. <br><br> We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.",
